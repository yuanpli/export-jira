Create an API token from your Atlassian account:

- Click Create API token.
- From the dialog that appears, enter a memorable and concise Label for your token and click Create.
- Click Copy to clipboard, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save

**Note:**

- For security reasons, it isn't possible to view the token after closing the creation dialog; if necessary, create a new token.
- You should store the token securely, just as for any password.
